      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to MixMate by Modfy Inc ("MixMate", "we", "us", or "our").
        MixMate provides a playlist creation service through Spotify. This
        Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and
        disclosure of information that we receive when you use our services.
      </p>

      <h2>No Data Collection and Storage</h2>
      <p>
        MixMate does not collect or store any personal data from its users. All
        interactions with MixMate are processed in real-time, and no user
        information is retained after the session ends.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Processing</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>User Queries</strong>: User queries related to song
          preferences or playlist types are sent to OpenAI and Spotify for
          processing. We do not store these queries or any information derived
          from them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Data Processing</strong>: Since we leverage OpenAI
          and Spotify for our service, users are subject to the privacy policies
          of these respective services.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Our service may contain links to third-party websites or services (like
        Spotify) that are not owned or controlled by MixMate. We have no control
        over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies,
        or practices of any third-party websites or services.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        MixMate does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from
        anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal
        information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as
        quickly as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
