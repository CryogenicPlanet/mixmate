Generate spotify playlist while talking to chatgpt


## Usage

1. Create a spotify app and get the client id and client secret
2. Create a .env file and the stuff from `src/env.mjs`
3. Have fun!


## TODOs
Not committing to building any of this but potential expansion ideas:
- [ ] Allow turbo to remove songs based on input, each {key: "song", value: "name", action: "add" | "remove"}
- [ ] Allow talking to your listen history and library, some kinda of system to get context from your existing library
